# Considering the data extracted from the BLS website, I would implement a simple script using Selenium or Beautiful Soup in Python to make a webscrap
# and download the csv file , that I saw the BLS website provide. If the site didn't provided the csv file I would make a scipt to webscrap 
# the page with the information that I want , generate a CSV file and then every month just run the script to have an atualized file.
# With the intention to automate the run of the script asweel I would schedule my script, with the Task Scheduler from Windowns or the Crontab from Linux,
# and configurate to run every month, since the data is updated every month.
